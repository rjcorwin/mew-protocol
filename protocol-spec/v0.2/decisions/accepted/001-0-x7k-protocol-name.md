# ADR-x7k: Protocol Name

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Context:** MCPx Protocol Draft Specification
**Incorporation:** Complete

## Context

The protocol needs a clear, memorable name that accurately represents its purpose and capabilities. The current name "MCPx" was a placeholder indicating an extension of MCP. A proper name should:
- Clearly indicate the multi-party nature
- Show the relationship to MCP
- Be memorable and pronounceable
- Accurately represent that humans are first-class participants
- Avoid conflicts with existing protocols

### Decision Drivers
- Accuracy in describing protocol purpose
- Clarity for new users
- Maintaining connection to MCP heritage
- Avoiding naming conflicts
- Marketability and memorability

## Decision

**Adopt MEUP (Multi-Entity Unified-Context Protocol) as the protocol name**

MEUP captures the protocol's core purpose of unifying context for multiple entities (humans, AI agents, robots, services). The name works as both protocol and CLI command ("meup into space"), making it memorable and action-oriented. While we use the full "Multi-Entity Unified-Context Protocol" expansion, the acronym intentionally drops the "C" to create the pronounceable "MEUP" rather than "MEUCP".

## Options Considered

### Option 1: MCPx (Status Quo)

Keep the current MCPx name.

**Pros:**
- Already in use
- Shows MCP extension clearly
- No migration needed

**Cons:**
- Unclear what "x" means
- Sounds like a placeholder
- Doesn't describe functionality

### Option 2: MECP - Multi-Entity Context Protocol

**Pros:**
- Clearly indicates multiple entities (not just models)
- Emphasizes shared context (key differentiator)
- Maintains MCP naming pattern
- Simple, pronounceable, memorable
- Accurately includes humans as entities

**Cons:**
- New acronym to learn
- Requires documentation updates

### Option 3: MPCP - Multi-Participant Context Protocol

**Pros:**
- "Participant" is inclusive of all entity types
- Maintains MCP prefix and pattern
- Clear functional description
- Natural language - everyone understands "participant"
- Avoids technical jargon
- Accurate terminology for the protocol's purpose

**Cons:**
- Very similar to MCP (one letter difference)
- Could be confused in speech/pronunciation
- "Participant" is less distinctive than "Entity"
- Longer acronym (4 letters)

### Option 4: MCPP - Model Context Space Protocol

**Pros:**
- Maintains MCP prefix
- Includes "space" terminology
- Clear lineage from MCP

**Cons:**
- "Model" doesn't accurately include human participants
- Ties protocol name to container metaphor
- Less descriptive of actual functionality

### Option 5: MACP - Multi-Agent Context Protocol

**Pros:**
- Clear multi-party indication
- Maintains MCP pattern
- Short and memorable

**Cons:**

- Easy to pronounce ("you-ex-pee" or "yux-p")
- Memorable and distinctive
- X can represent the intersection/crossing of entities and context
- Mathematical/technical appeal
- Future-proof - X can evolve in meaning

**Cons:**

## Implementation Details

### Protocol Identifier
```json
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1"
}
```

### Package Naming
- NPM organization: `@meup`
- Repository: `meup-protocol` or similar
- Package structure:
  - `@meup/sdk` - Core SDK
  - `@meup/gateway` - Gateway server
  - `@meup/bridge` - MCP-to-MEUP bridge
  - `meup` - CLI tool (note: no @meup prefix for easier typing)

```

### Documentation Updates
- Replace all instances of "MCPx" and "MECP" with "MEUP"
- Update protocol description to emphasize unified context
- Embrace the playful nature in examples and tutorials

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear Purpose**: Name describes what the protocol does
- **Inclusive**: "Entity" covers humans, AI, robots, services
- **MCP Heritage**: Maintains naming pattern and connection
- **Professional**: Sounds like a real protocol, not a placeholder
- **No Conflicts**: No known conflicts with existing protocols

### Negative
- **Breaking Change**: Requires updating all references
- **New Learning**: Users must learn new acronym
- **SEO Impact**: Lose any existing "MCPx" search presence

## Migration Path

Since this is v0.x (experimental):
1. Direct cutover to MEUP naming
2. Update all documentation and folder structures
3. Create new packages under @meup organization
4. Emphasize the "meup into context" concept in messaging
5. No backward compatibility needed in v0.x
