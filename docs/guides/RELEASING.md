# Release Process

This document describes the process for releasing new versions of the MEW Protocol specification.

## Version Numbering

MEW Protocol uses a simple version scheme during the experimental phase:
- `v0.x` - Experimental versions with breaking changes allowed
- `v1.0` - First stable release with compatibility guarantees
- Post-v1.0 will follow semantic versioning

## Release Checklist

### 1. Prepare the Release

- [ ] Review all ADRs in `proposed/` folder
- [ ] For each ADR to be accepted:
  - [ ] Fully incorporate the ADR into `spec/draft/SPEC.md`
  - [ ] Update ADR's incorporation field to "Complete"
  - [ ] Move ADR from `proposed/` to `accepted/`
  - [ ] Update ADR status to "Accepted"
- [ ] Move rejected ADRs to `rejected/` folder with rejection rationale
- [ ] Fix any inconsistencies or errors in the specification
- [ ] Update the protocol version throughout the spec (search for previous version)
- [ ] Update the date in the specification header

### 2. Create Version Folder

```bash
# Copy draft to versioned folder
cp -r spec/draft spec/v0.x
```

- [ ] Update header in `spec/v0.x/SPEC.md` to remove "Draft" status
- [ ] Create `spec/v0.x/README.md` with version overview

### 3. Update Project Files

- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes for this version
- [ ] Update `TODO.md` to mark completed tasks
- [ ] Update main `README.md` if needed to reference new version

### 4. Git Operations

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Release MEW Protocol v0.x

- Brief summary of major changes
- Reference to CHANGELOG for details"

# Tag the release
git tag -a v0.x -m "MEW Protocol v0.x - Brief description"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
git push origin v0.x
```

### 5. GitHub Release

1. Go to GitHub releases page
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Select the tag `v0.x`
4. Title: "MEW Protocol v0.x"
5. Copy relevant sections from `CHANGELOG.md` to release description
6. Attach `spec/v0.x/SPEC.md` as a release asset (optional)
7. Mark as "Pre-release" if still experimental (v0.x)
8. Publish release

### 6. Post-Release

- [ ] Continue development in `spec/draft/` for next version
- [ ] Update protocol version in draft to next planned version
- [ ] Create new "Unreleased" section in `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Announce release in relevant channels

## Version-Specific Folders

Each released version gets a frozen snapshot in `spec/v0.x/`:
- The versioned folder is never modified after release
- All future development happens in `spec/draft/`
- This preserves exact specification for each version

## Breaking Changes Policy

### During v0.x (Experimental)
- Breaking changes allowed between any version
- No migration guides required
- Clear documentation of changes in CHANGELOG

### After v1.0 (Stable)
- Breaking changes require major version bump
- Migration guides required
- Deprecation notices for at least one minor version

## Emergency Fixes

If critical errors are found in a released specification:
1. Fix in `spec/draft/`
2. Release as new version (never modify released versions)
3. Document the issue and fix in CHANGELOG
4. Consider adding erratum notice to affected version's README
