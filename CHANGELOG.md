**Implementation Progress:**
- Phase 1 (Control points & aiming): ✅ COMPLETE
  - ✅ Ship server initialization (2 port, 2 starboard cannons)
  - ✅ Cannon config with 4s cooldown
  - ✅ Grab/release implementation (server + client)
  - ✅ Aim system (±45° clamping, isometric rotation)
  - ✅ Fire method (cooldown enforcement)
  - ✅ Client interaction detection (30px proximity)
  - ✅ Input handling (E key grab/release, arrows aim, space fire)
  - ✅ Visual rendering (orange/yellow/red circles)
  - ✅ Aim arc visualization (cyan arc, magenta aim line, crosshair)
  - ✅ Cooldown indicator (gray shrinking circle)
  - ✅ Message handlers (all 4 cannon messages implemented)
- Phase 2 (Firing & projectiles): 🔲 Not started
  - Next: Projectile spawn on fire, physics simulation, trail effects
- Phase 3 (Collision & damage): 🔲 Not started
- Phase 4 (Sinking & respawn): 🔲 Not started
- Phase 5 (Polish & sounds): 🔲 Not started

**New Protocol Messages:**
- `ship/aim_cannon` - Adjust cannon aim angle

  - Agent can use tags for internal planning without cluttering user view
  - Implemented in `src/cli/ui/utils/thinkingFilter.ts`
  - Updated coder-agent prompt to use thinking tags

#### Improved Coding Agent
- **Better prompts and filesystem handling**
  - Updated system prompt with thinking tag guidance
  - Filesystem hygiene: excludes `node_modules`, `.git`, `.mew/node_modules`, `dist`, `build`
