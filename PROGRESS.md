# MEW Protocol Development Progress

## Current Status (2025-01-15)

### 🎉 Recent Achievements

#### v0.2.0 Released to npm
- Successfully published `@mew-protocol/cli` version 0.2.0
- Package available at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mew-protocol/cli
- Install with: `npm install -g @mew-protocol/cli`

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Seamless Init-to-Connect Flow (Fixed)
- **Problem Solved**: After `mew init`, the command now automatically continues to start and connect
- **Implementation**: Spawns new process to run `mew space up -i` after initialization
- **Flow**: `mew` → init → start → connect all in one command

#### MCP Operation Approval Dialog (Phase 1 Complete)
- **Problem Solved**: Fixed input focus issues where keystrokes appeared in input field during approval
- **Implementation**: Option 2 from ADR-009 (Simple Numbered List MVP)
- **Features Added**:
  - Arrow key navigation (↑↓) with visual selection indicator
  - Enter key to confirm selection
  - Number key shortcuts (1/2) for quick approval/denial
  - Escape key to cancel
  - Proper focus management with input composer disabled during dialogs
  - Generic template that works for all operation types

#### Enhanced `mew` Command Behavior
- **Smart Default Actions**:
  - First run (no space): `mew` → init → start & connect
  - Space exists but stopped: `mew` → start & connect
  - Space running: `mew` → connect
- **Port Conflict Resolution**:
  - Automatically finds next available port when default is in use
  - Prevents duplicate gateways for the same space
  - Updates all references to use the selected port

#### Template System for `mew init`
- Built-in templates: `coder-agent` and `note-taker`
- Interactive template selection
- Isolated dependencies in `.mew/` directory
- Keeps project root clean

#### Improved Interactive UI
- Better formatting for reasoning messages
- Visual reasoning status with spinner animation
- Context-aware message display
- Enhanced message formatting for all types

### 🚧 Known Issues to Address

1. **UI Layout Issue**: After approval dialog, input box position is incorrect with whitespace below
2. **Race Condition**: When MCP filesystem joins before coder agent, tools aren't discovered properly
   - Coder agent should request tools before reasoning
   - Need to clear tool cache when participants rejoin

### 📋 Upcoming Work

#### Phase 2: Tool-Specific Templates (Next Priority)
- Detect operation type from method and tool name
- Create optimized templates for:
  - File operations (read/write/delete with previews)
  - Command execution (npm/shell/git with risk assessment)
  - Network requests (URL/method/headers display)
  - Database operations (query preview)
- Maintain consistent interaction pattern across all templates

#### Phase 3: Capability Grants (Future)
- Add "Yes, allow X to Y" option (3rd choice in dialog)
- Send MEW Protocol `capability/grant` messages
- Track granted capabilities per participant
- Skip approval prompts for granted operations
- Session-scoped permissions (not persistent)

```

### 🔧 Development Setup

```bash
# Install latest CLI globally
npm install -g @mew-protocol/cli@0.2.0

# Test the new features
mkdir test-space && cd test-space
mew  # Will trigger init → start → connect flow

# For development
cd mew-protocol/cli
npm install
npm run lint
```

### 📈 Metrics

- **Package Size**: 45.2 KB compressed
- **Files**: 27 files in npm package
- **Dependencies**: Managed locally in workspaces
- **Test Coverage**: Basic functional testing in place

### 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ Approval dialog no longer has input focus issues
✅ Users can navigate intuitively with arrows or numbers
✅ `mew` command provides smart defaults
✅ Port conflicts handled automatically
✅ Templates make initialization easy

### 🔮 Vision

The MEW Protocol is evolving toward a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system where:
1. **Transparency**: All agent interactions visible in shared workspace
2. **Control**: Humans approve operations through intuitive dialogs
3. **Progressive Trust**: Capabilities expand as agents prove reliable
4. **Tool Interoperability**: Agents discover and use each other's tools dynamically

### 📝 Notes for Contributors

- Lint errors exist in legacy files but don't affect new features
- Focus on Phase 2 (tool-specific templates) for next iteration
- Consider ADR for handling the race condition with tool discovery
- UI layout issue needs investigation in Ink components
