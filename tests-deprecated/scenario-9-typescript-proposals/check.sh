# IMPORTANT: Tool Discovery Behavior
# -----------------------------------
# Agents should automatically discover ALL tools from ALL participants when they join a space.
# Tools should be presented as a unified list with naming convention: "participant-id:tool-name"
# When an agent needs to call a tool, it should:
#   1. Identify which participant owns the tool (from the prefix)
#   2. Send the appropriate mcp/request or mcp/proposal to that participant
#   3. The agent's implementation handles the routing transparently
#
# This test validates the propose->fulfill->response pattern where:
# - Agent with limited capabilities creates proposals for operations it cannot perform
# - Human or authorized participant fulfills the proposal
# - Target participant executes and responds
