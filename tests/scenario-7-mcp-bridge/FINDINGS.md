# Scenario 7 MCP Bridge Test - Investigation Findings

## Issue
The MCP Bridge test (scenario 7) times out when sending MCP requests to the filesystem bridge participant.

## Root Cause
The filesystem bridge is not responding to incoming MCP requests (`tools/list`, `tools/call`).

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Bridge Initialization ✅
- The MCP bridge successfully starts and connects to the gateway
- The MCP server (filesystem server) initializes correctly
- The bridge successfully discovers and registers 14 tools from the MCP server
- Tools are properly registered with the MEWParticipant base class

### 2. Message Routing ✅
- Test client successfully sends MCP requests to the filesystem participant
- Messages are properly routed through the gateway
- The gateway accepts and forwards the messages

### 3. Message Reception ❌
**This is where the issue occurs:**
- The filesystem bridge does not appear to be receiving or processing incoming MEW messages
- No response is sent back for `mcp/request` messages
- The bridge doesn't respond even to simple `chat` messages

### 4. Capability Configuration ✅
- The filesystem participant has `mcp/response` capability (can send responses)
- The test-client has `mcp/request` capability with `tools/*` permission
- Capabilities are correctly configured in space.yaml

## Technical Details

### Expected Flow:
1. test-client sends `mcp/request` with method `tools/list` to filesystem
2. filesystem bridge receives the message via MEWParticipant's message handler
3. MEWParticipant's `handleMCPRequest` processes the request
4. MEWParticipant's `handleToolsList` returns the registered tools
5. Response is sent back to test-client

### Actual Flow:
1. test-client sends `mcp/request` ✅
2. Gateway routes message ✅
3. **Bridge doesn't process the message** ❌
4. No response is generated
5. Test times out waiting for response

## Potential Issues

1. **Message Handler Setup**: The bridge may not be properly setting up the message handler from MEWParticipant
2. **onReady Hook**: The bridge's `onReady()` method might not be completing properly
3. **WebSocket Connection**: While the connection appears established, messages might not be flowing
4. **Event Registration**: The bridge might not be registering for the correct message events

## Next Steps for Fix

1. Add debug logging to MEWParticipant's message handler
2. Verify that the bridge's WebSocket is receiving raw messages
3. Check if `onMessage` event handler is properly set up in the bridge
4. Ensure the bridge calls parent class initialization properly
5. Add logging to track message flow through the participant

## Test Results Summary
- Tests 1-6: ✅ All passing
- Test 7: ⏱️ Times out (MCP Bridge issue documented here)

The core message queueing feature implementation is working correctly, as evidenced by the other tests passing.
