# Scenario 9-typescript-proposals - Test Timeout Issue

## Status
⚠️ Refactor complete, test timeout during checks

## Refactor Changes Completed
- ✅ Updated teardown.sh to use global `mew` command
- ✅ Updated setup.sh SDK paths:
  - `sdk/typescript-sdk/agent/dist/index.js` → `packages/mew/dist/agent/index.js`
  - `sdk/typescript-sdk/participant/dist/index.js` → `packages/mew/dist/participant/index.js`
- ✅ Updated space.yaml agent path:
  - `../../../sdk/typescript-sdk/agent/dist/index.js` → `../../../packages/mew/dist/agent/index.js`
- ✅ Removed package.json (old `@mew-protocol/agent` dependency)

## Test Results
- Gateway health endpoint ✓
- **Test times out during checks phase** (waiting for TypeScript agent behavior)

## Issue
Test setup completes successfully (gateway starts, health check passes, TypeScript agent starts), but the test times out waiting for the agent to respond during the checks phase.

## Agent Configuration
The TypeScript agent is configured with:
```yaml
env:
  MEW_AGENT_CONFIG: '{"mockLLM":true,"autoRespond":true}'
```

This suggests the agent should automatically respond to messages, but it's not working as expected.

## Likely Causes
1. **Mock LLM not functioning**: The `mockLLM: true` configuration may not be working correctly in the consolidated package
2. **Auto-respond logic broken**: The `autoRespond: true` flag may not trigger responses
3. **Agent initialization issue**: The agent may not be properly initialized or connected
4. **Message handling**: The agent may not be receiving or processing chat messages

## Related Test
Scenario 8-typescript-agent has the same configuration and also times out, suggesting a common issue with the TypeScript agent mock LLM functionality.

## Next Steps
1. Check TypeScript agent mock LLM implementation in `packages/mew/src/agent/`
2. Verify agent auto-respond logic
3. Add debug logging to agent startup and message handling
4. Test agent with a simple manual message to see if it responds at all
5. Check if mock LLM configuration is being read correctly

## Note
The refactor changes are complete and correct. The test timeout appears to be a functional issue with the TypeScript agent's mock LLM feature, not related to the repository restructuring.
