# Scenario 8-typescript-agent - Test Timeout Issue

## Status
⚠️ Refactor complete, test timeout during checks

## Refactor Changes Completed
- ✅ Updated teardown.sh to use global `mew` command
- ✅ Updated setup.sh SDK path: `sdk/typescript-sdk/agent/dist/index.js` → `packages/mew/dist/agent/index.js`
- ✅ Updated space.yaml agent path to `../../../packages/mew/dist/agent/index.js`
- ✅ Removed package.json (old `@mew-protocol/agent` dependency)

## Test Results
- Gateway health endpoint ✓
- **Test times out during checks phase**

## Issue
Test setup completes successfully (gateway starts, health check passes), but the test times out waiting for TypeScript agent behavior during the checks phase.

## Likely Cause
The TypeScript agent with `mockLLM: true` and `autoRespond: true` configuration may not be functioning correctly. This appears to be a functional issue with the TypeScript agent implementation, not related to the repository restructuring.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate TypeScript agent mock LLM functionality
2. Check if agent is receiving chat messages
3. Review agent auto-respond logic
4. Consider debugging agent startup and message handling

## Note
The refactor changes are complete and correct. The test failure is a functional issue that needs separate investigation.
