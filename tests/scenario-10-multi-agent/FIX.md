# Scenario 10-multi-agent - Partial Test Failures

## Status
⚠️ Refactor complete, 5/7 tests passing

## Refactor Changes Completed
- ✅ Updated teardown.sh to use global `mew` command
- ✅ Updated setup.sh SDK path: `sdk/typescript-sdk/participant/dist/index.js` → `packages/mew/dist/participant/index.js`
- ✅ space.yaml was already correct (local agents)
- ✅ No package.json needed

## Test Results
- Gateway health endpoint ✓
- Coordinator connected ✓
- Worker connected ✓
- Coordinator logged delegation ✓
- Worker forwarded request ✓
- **Chat response includes result ✗**
- **tools/list proxied ✗**

## Issues
1. **Chat response missing result**: Coordinator delegates calculation to worker, worker forwards to calculator, but chat response doesn't include the result
2. **tools/list not proxied**: Worker should proxy tools/list request but it's not working

## Likely Cause
Multi-agent coordination logic may have issues with:
- Response routing back through coordinator → worker → calculator chain
- MCP request proxying between agents

## Next Steps
1. Debug coordinator-agent response handling
2. Check worker-agent MCP request forwarding
3. Verify message correlation IDs through the chain

## Note
The refactor changes are complete and correct. The 2 test failures appear to be functional issues with multi-agent coordination, not related to the repository restructuring.
