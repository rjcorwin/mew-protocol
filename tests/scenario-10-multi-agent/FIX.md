# Scenario 10-multi-agent - RESOLVED

## Status
✅ Fixed and passing

## Issue
Partial test failures (5/7 tests passing) - calculator agent failed to start due to module resolution error.

## Root Cause
Same as scenario-9: calculator-participant.js used `require('@mew-protocol/participant')` which doesn't exist after repository consolidation.

## Solution
Updated the require path in `template/agents/calculator-participant.js`:

```javascript
// Before:
const { MEWParticipant } = require('@mew-protocol/participant');

// After:
const { MEWParticipant } = require('../../../../../packages/mew/dist/participant/index.js');
```

## Test Results
All 7 tests now pass:
- ✓ Gateway health endpoint
- ✓ Coordinator connected
- ✓ Worker connected
- ✓ Chat response includes result (4 + 6 = 10)
- ✓ Coordinator logged delegation
- ✓ Worker forwarded request
- ✓ tools/list proxied

## Files Changed
- `tests/scenario-10-multi-agent/template/agents/calculator-participant.js` - Updated MEWParticipant require path

## Notes
The coordinator and worker agents use raw WebSocket connections and didn't need updates. Only the calculator participant uses the MEWParticipant SDK.
