# ADR-v2c: Proposal Lifecycle Extensions

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Context:** MEUP Protocol Draft Specification
**Incorporation:** Complete
**Related ADRs:** 002-0-m3p (Message Kind Namespace Pattern)

## Context

The current MEUP specification (SPEC.md Section 3.2) defines proposals as a way for capability-restricted participants to suggest operations. However, it only defines the basic propose→fulfill pattern without any lifecycle management.

### Current Spec Capabilities
- `mcp.proposal` message kind with method in payload
- Fulfillment via `mcp.request` with `correlation_id` 
- Capability-based access control with payload inspection

### Problems with Current Design
1. **Waiting on dead proposals**: Proposers wait for timeout even when no one will fulfill
2. **No cancellation**: Can't withdraw proposals that are no longer needed
3. **No feedback mechanism**: Targeted participants can't indicate they won't fulfill
4. **Resource waste**: Proposals sit until timeout with no way to clean up

### Requirements for Extensions
- Must maintain fire-and-forget philosophy (like MCP)
- Must preserve stateless gateway design
- Should solve the waiting problem for targeted proposals
- Should allow proposal cancellation
- Must use existing MEUP envelope structure

## Decision

Implement **Option 9: Dedicated MCP Lifecycle Kinds**:
1. **Optional targeting** via envelope's `to` field (already supported)
2. **`mcp.withdraw`** messages for proposers to cancel proposals
3. **`mcp.reject`** messages to provide quick feedback on proposals

### Message Kind Design

While ADR-m3p advocates for minimal `kind` fields with payload inspection, proposal lifecycle operations warrant dedicated kinds because:
- **Clear intent** - `mcp.withdraw` and `mcp.reject` immediately convey purpose
- **Proposal-specific semantics** - These operations are inherently tied to the proposal pattern
- **Simpler routing** - No payload inspection needed for basic message routing
- **Minimal payloads** - Just a `reason` field, with context from `correlationId`

The dedicated kinds are:
- `mcp.proposal` - Existing proposal message
- `mcp.withdraw` - Withdraw a proposal (proposer only)
- `mcp.reject` - Reject a proposal (any participant)

This provides practical lifecycle management with clear, specific message types.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Minimal Fire-and-Forget (Current State)

Keep the current spec as-is with no lifecycle management.

**Messages**: 
- `mcp.proposal` → `mcp.request` (fulfillment)

**Pros**:
- Dead simple, already implemented
- No new message types
- Matches MCP philosophy

**Cons**:
- Proposers wait for timeout unnecessarily
- No way to cancel proposals
- No feedback mechanism

---

### Option 2: Acknowledgment-Based

Add acknowledgment messages to indicate consideration.

**Messages**:
- `mcp.proposal` → `meup.lifecycle` (ack) → `mcp.request` or `meup.lifecycle` (decline)

**Pros**:
- Proposer knows someone is considering
- Quick feedback on non-fulfillment

**Cons**:
- More complex state machine
- Ack doesn't guarantee fulfillment
- Breaks fire-and-forget pattern

---

### Option 3: Claim-Based (Exclusive)

Add exclusive claiming mechanism.

**Messages**:
- `mcp.proposal` → `meup.lifecycle` (claim) → `mcp.request` or `meup.lifecycle` (release)

**Pros**:
- No duplicate work
- Clear ownership

**Cons**:
- Requires coordination/locking
- Single point of failure
- Not truly decentralized

---

### Option 4: Bid-Based Competition

Add bidding mechanism for proposals.

**Messages**:
- `mcp.proposal` → `meup.lifecycle` (bid) → `meup.lifecycle` (award) → `mcp.request`

**Pros**:
- Best agent self-selects
- Market-like efficiency

**Cons**:
- Very complex coordination
- Delays start of work
- Overkill for most use cases

---

### Option 5: Progressive Lifecycle (Recommended)

Add minimal lifecycle extensions for practical needs.

**Messages**:
```json
// Proposal with optional targeting
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "prop-123",
  "from": "untrusted-agent",
  "to": ["filesystem-agent"],  // Optional targeting
  "kind": "mcp.proposal",
  "payload": {
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": { ... }
  }
}

// Withdrawal (proposer cancels)
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "withdraw-456",
  "from": "untrusted-agent",
  "correlationId": "prop-123",
  "kind": "meup.lifecycle",
  "payload": {
    "operation": "withdraw",
    "target": "proposal",
    "reason": "No longer needed"
  }
}

// Rejection (only for targeted proposals)
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "reject-789",
  "from": "filesystem-agent",
  "to": ["untrusted-agent"],
  "correlationId": "prop-123",
  "kind": "meup.lifecycle",
  "payload": {
    "operation": "reject",
    "target": "proposal",
    "reason": "busy"
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Solves waiting problem for targeted case
- Allows cancellation
- Fire-and-forget pattern maintained
- Simple to implement

**Cons**:
- No feedback for broadcast proposals
- No coordination between fulfillers

---

### Option 6: Two-Phase Commit Style

Add two-phase commit pattern.

**Messages**:
- `mcp.proposal` → `meup.lifecycle` (prepare) → `meup.lifecycle` (commit/abort)

**Pros**:
- Strong consistency
- Full control

**Cons**:
- Very complex
- Multiple round trips
- Overkill for MEUP goals

---

### Option 7: TTL-Based Expiration

Add time-to-live to proposals.

**Messages**:
- `mcp.proposal` (with TTL field) → auto-expiration

**Pros**:
- Automatic cleanup
- Simple time-based logic

**Cons**:
- Can't cancel early
- No rejection mechanism
- Requires time sync

---

### Option 8: Lightweight Status Updates (New consideration)

Add optional status messages for transparency.

**Messages**:
```json
// Status update
{
  "kind": "meup.lifecycle",
  "correlationId": "prop-123",
  "payload": {
    "operation": "status",
    "target": "proposal",
    "status": "considering" | "queued" | "processing" | "unable"
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Provides feedback without commitment
- Helps proposers understand delays
- Lightweight and optional

**Cons**:
- More message types
- Not a guarantee of fulfillment
- Could become chatty

---

### Option 9: Dedicated MCP Lifecycle Kinds

Use specific MCP kinds for lifecycle operations instead of generic `meup.lifecycle`.

**Messages**:
```json
// Proposal with optional targeting
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "prop-123",
  "from": "untrusted-agent",
  "to": ["filesystem-agent"],  // Optional targeting
  "kind": "mcp.proposal",
  "payload": {
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": { ... }
  }
}

// Withdrawal (proposer cancels)
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "withdraw-456",
  "from": "untrusted-agent",
  "correlationId": "prop-123",  // Points to the proposal being withdrawn
  "kind": "mcp.withdraw",
  "payload": {
    "reason": "No longer needed"
  }
}

// Rejection
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "reject-789",
  "from": "filesystem-agent",
  "to": ["untrusted-agent"],
  "correlationId": "prop-123",  // Points to the proposal being rejected
  "kind": "mcp.reject",
  "payload": {
    "reason": "busy"
  }
}

// Follow-up explanation via chat (optional)
{
  "protocol": "meup/v0.1",
  "id": "chat-790",
  "from": "filesystem-agent",
  "to": ["untrusted-agent"],
  "correlationId": "reject-789",  // References the rejection
  "kind": "chat",
  "payload": {
    "message": "I'm currently processing a large batch operation that requires exclusive file access. Please retry in about 5 minutes."
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Clear, specific message types
- Follows MCP namespace for MCP-related operations
- Simple to understand intent from `kind` alone
- No payload inspection needed for basic routing
- Minimal payload - just reason field
- Context clear from correlationId
- **Non-blocking**: Lifecycle decisions can be made quickly without waiting for explanation generation
- **Async reasoning**: Detailed explanations can be generated and sent later via chat

**Cons**:
- More `kind` values to track
- Less consistent with minimal kind pattern from ADR-m3p
- Could proliferate into many specific kinds (mcp.withdraw, mcp.reject, mcp.status, etc.)
- These kinds are implicitly proposal-specific (not obvious from the name alone)

## Implementation Requirements

### New Capabilities Required

Using the JSON pattern matching from ADR-q8f:

```yaml
# Can withdraw proposals (typically own proposals)
- kind: "mcp.withdraw"

# Can reject proposals
- kind: "mcp.reject"
```

Note: Since these are dedicated kinds, no payload inspection is needed for basic capability checking.

### Behavior Rules
1. **Withdrawal (`mcp.withdraw`)**:
   - Only original proposer can withdraw their own proposals
   - Fire-and-forget (no confirmation)
   - Uses `correlationId` to reference the proposal being withdrawn
   - Payload contains only `reason` field

2. **Rejection (`mcp.reject`)**:
   - Any participant with capability can reject proposals
   - Particularly useful when explicitly targeted in a proposal
   - Fire-and-forget (no confirmation)
   - Payload contains only `reason` field
   - Common reason codes:
     - `"disagree"` - Don't agree with the proposed action
     - `"inappropriate"` - Not suitable for the current context
     - `"unsafe"` - Could cause harm or unintended consequences
     - `"busy"` - Currently handling other work
     - `"incapable"` - Don't have the required tools/access
     - `"policy"` - Violates security or operational policy
     - `"duplicate"` - Already being handled by another participant
     - `"invalid"` - Proposal is malformed or impossible
     - `"timeout"` - Too old or expired
     - `"resource_limit"` - Would exceed resource constraints
     - `"other"` - Reason not covered above
   - Helps prevent unnecessary waiting
   - Detailed explanations can be sent as follow-up `chat` messages with `correlationId`
   - **Non-blocking pattern**: Participants can reject/withdraw immediately with a reason code, then asynchronously generate and send detailed explanations via chat when ready

3. **Gateway**:
   - Validates message structure
   - Routes based on `kind` field (no payload inspection needed for these)
   - Checks capabilities using simple kind matching
   - Remains stateless

## Security Considerations

- Only proposer can withdraw their own proposals
- Rejection doesn't grant any execution capability
- Gateway validates message `kind` against capabilities
- No DoS via message spam (fire-and-forget limits impact)

## Future Extensions

- TTL support could be added later if needed
- Capability-based routing (e.g., find agents with specific tools)
- Batch operations (withdraw multiple proposals)

## Migration Impact

These are additive changes:
- Existing proposals continue to work
- New message types are optional
- Backward compatible with current spec

## Open Questions

1. Should system emit notifications when proposals expire?
2. Should rejection be required for targeted proposals?
3. How do orchestrators learn from rejection patterns?
4. Should we standardize reason codes vs allow freeform text? (Answer: standardized codes)
5. ~~Alternative: Should detailed explanations be sent as follow-up `chat` messages for human readability?~~ (Answer: Yes, using correlationId)
