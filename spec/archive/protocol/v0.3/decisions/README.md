# Draft Protocol Decisions

This directory will contain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the next version of the MEUP protocol.

## Current Status

No active decisions for the draft version. All v0.2 decisions have been incorporated and are available in `/spec/v0.2/decisions/`.

## Directory Structure

- `accepted/` - Approved ADRs for the next version

## Creating New ADRs

When proposing changes for the next protocol version:

1. Create ADR in `proposed/` with format: `[number]-[id]-[name].md`
2. Use unique 3-character ID (e.g., `a1b`)
3. Follow ADR template from `/spec/CLAUDE.md`
4. Reference this as "MEUP Protocol Next" or specific version when known
