# Aurora Skiff MCP Bridge

This directory reserves room for future MCP tooling that will pilot the demo ship. The default template uses the constant heading controller from `src/game/isometric`, but you can replace it by building an MCP server here and updating the `space.yaml` entry for the `aurora-skiff` participant.
